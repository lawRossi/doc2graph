# Building predicate-centric knolwedge graphs from raw text documents

## Introduction

### Motivation
Knolwdge graphs have drawn much attentions in recentyears and have been applied widely. At the present, there're some public knolwedge graphs, such as wikidata and DBpedia. Both of them are built based on wikipedia. Knolwedges such as entity attributes and entity relations are extracted from semi-structured information, such as inforbox. Though these knowledge grahs are large, a lot of information recorded in wikipedia is missing due to the limitation of semi-structured information in wikipedia. To tackle with this issue, we need to extract useful information from raw text documents in wikipedia. Thus, there's no doubt that it's very important to develop the technology to extract information from raw text.

### Example
The knowledge built from the following text is illustrated in figure1.

Beethoven was born in Bonn, the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire.At the age of 21 he moved to Vienna, where he began studying composition with Joseph Haydn.

### Characteristics of the built knolwedge graph
- predicate-centric representation

  Predicates are represented as nodes and an edge starts with a predicate and ends with a noun phrase.
  In this way, n-ary relations can be represented with traditional knowledge graph repsentation.

- canonicalized noun phrases

  Noun phrases are linked to the entities in an existing knolwedge graph so that different names of the same entity can be detected.

- context-rich

  Unlike traditional (subject; predicate; object) facts, adverbials that provide useful information like address, time are extracted. These adverbials act as the context of the facts so they need to be extracted.

### Applications
- generating assertions

  Assertions (facts) can be generated with the extacted tuples.

- document representation

  The built knolwedge graph can act as graph-based representation of the document. And it can be used to do document comparision and train the document embedding.

- document summarization

  The extracted tuples ( or the knowledge graph ) can act as the summarization of the documents.

## Approach

#### 1.Syntax Parsing

 Parsing the sentences with a dependency parser.

#### 2. Phrase Chunking

 Recognizing noun and verb phrases.

#### 3. Tuple extraction

 Tuples are extracted according to syntatic rules. At first, defifferent clauses are detected. Then tuples are extracted according to the clause type.

  Basic clauses:

| clause type | example | extractions |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| SV | Beethoven moved. |Beethoven; moved; |
|SVP | Beethoven was a composer. |Beethoven; be; a composer|
|SVO | Beethoven began studying composition.|Beethoven; began studying; composition|
|SVOO| Beethoven played him a piece of music.|Beethoven; play; a piece of music <br>Bethoven; play; him|
|SVC |  Beethoven died yough.| Beethoven; died;|

 Clauses with adverbials:

| clause type | example | extractions |
|-------------|---------|------------|
|SVA|Bethoven moved to Viena.|Beethoven; moved; to Viena|
|SVPA|Beethoven was a child in 1999.|Beethoven; be; a child <br> Beethoven; be; in 1776|
|SVOA|Beethoven began studying composition with Joseph Haydn.|Beethoven; began studying; composition <br>Beethoven; began studying; with Joseph Haydn|
|SVOOA|Beethoven Beethoven played him a piece of music in 1796.|Beethoven; play; a piece of music <br> Beethoven; play; him <br>Beethoven; play; in 1796|

Figure3 shows a running example of the above steps.

#### 4.Tuple Refinement

 Corefence are detected. Predicate words are refined.

#### 5.Constructing Graph

 Constructing the graph with the extracted tuples.

#### 6.Entity Linking

 Noun phrases are linked to the corresponding entities in Dbpedia so that they are canonicalized.

### sentence simplification

The above approach of tuple extraction depends on dependency parsing. The main drawback is that most dependency parser don't achieve high accuracy. This has large impact on the extraction of tuples. Thus we need to mitigate the impact of the parsing error. Based on the observation that complex sentences are more difficult to be parsed correctly, we proposed to do sentence decomposition before tuple extraction.

Rules for sentence decompostion.

|special clause|example|
|----|-------|
|appositive| His brother, an doctor, is famous. -> "His brother is an doctor" "His brother is famous"|
|participial phrases|The boy killed by the man was found. -> "The boy be killed by the man" "The boy was found" <br> The man went in the room, waving his arms. -> "The man went in the room" "The man wave his arms."|
|adjective and adverb phrases|Aware of the danger, he was careful. -> "He be aware of the danger" "he was careful"|
|leading noun phrases|A crucial figure in classical music, Beethoven remains one of the most recognised composers. -> "Beethoven be a crucial figure in classical music" "Beethoven remains one of the most recognised composers"|
|adverb clause|When he was a child, his family was poor. -> "When he was a child." "his family was poor"|
|adjective clause|The boy who was a thief was arrested. -> "The boy was a thief" "The boy was arrested"|

These sepecial clauses are detected according to the parsing result of the sentence. Therefore, this process also depends on the dependency parser. To reduce the impact of dependency error on the decomposition process, we proposed to perform lexical simplification before sentence decomposition. The main idas is that removing words that act as modifiers would not change the syntactic structure of the original sentence, while this may help the parser to parse the sentence correctly. The remaining of this section illustrates this idea through an example.<br>

original sentence: <br>

Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before <b>the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season</b>, and started <b>a new career in Minor League Baseball</b>, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to <b>three additional championships</b> in 1996, 1997, and 1998, and <b>a then-record 72 regularseason wins in the 1995–96 NBA season</b>.

the parsing result of the original sentence:

</div>

the sentence after replacing noun phrases with head words and removing noun-modifier of nouns:<br>

Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball <b>before the beginning</b>, and started a career, he returned to the Bulls <b>in March 1995</b> and led them to championships <b>in 1996 , 1997 , and 1998</b> , and a wins .

the sentence after removing extra noun-modifier of verbs: <br>
Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball, and started a career, he returned to the Bulls and led them to championships, as well as a wins .

the parsing result of the simplified sentence:

<div align="center">
  <img src="data/imgs/parsing_result_original.png" width="80%"/>
</div>

decomposition of the simplified sentence:
- Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball
- Jordan started a career
- he returned to the Bulls
- he led them to championships, as well as a wins .

decompoistion after reconstruction:
- Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season.
- Jordan started a new career in Minor League Baseball
- he returned to the Bulls in March 1995
- he led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, and a then-record 72 regularseason wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.

### collision resolution
Note that tuples are extracted from both the original sentences and decomposed sentences. In this way, recall is
boosted. However, the extracted tuples may cause collision. In order to improve the precison of tuple extraction,
we need to resolve the collision among tuples.

Example:<br>
<code>
Jordan's individual accolades include fourteen NBA All - Star Game selections.
<br>(Jordan's individual accolades, include, fourteen NBA All)
<br>(Jordan's individual accolades, include, fourteen NBA All - Star Game selections)
</code>

We can see that two tuples are extracted from the sentence. These tuples cause collision because "fourteen NBA All"
and "fourteen NBA All - Star Game selections" are overlaped.

In order to resolve the collision among the extracted tuples, some tuples need to be removed so that there are no overlaped phrases. We try to remove tuples with a greedy strategy. In detail, for each pair of overlaped phrases, their corresponding nodes in the built knolwedge graph are connected with an edge with label "collision"; then a subgraph contains all nodes connected with at least one "collision" edge are extracted and only "collision" edges in the subgraph are kept; finally maximum independent set is found and only thoses nodes in the subgraph that are not in this set are removed from the knowedge graph (and the corresponding tuple are also removed).
